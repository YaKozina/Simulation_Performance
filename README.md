# Simulation_Performance
Quantify computation requirements (time, memory) for simulation

The original task: https://github.com/Shoram444/SN_simulation_setup_codes/issues/1

**At this moment (July 2025) there are available results for such processes:**

* Se-82 0νββ (foil_bulk)
* Se-82 2νββ (foil_bulk)
* Tl-208 (foil_bulk SOURCE BACKGROUND)
* Bi-214 (foil_bulk SOURCE BACKGROUND)
  
As soon as possible to this study will be included some other processes
